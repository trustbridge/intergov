class ProcessMessageUseCase:
    """
    Used by the message processing background worker.

    Gets one message from the channel inbox
    and does number of things with it.

    * dispatch document retreval job
      (if the message is from a foreign source)
    * dispatch message sending task to channel-outbox
      (if the message is from a domestic source)
    * ensure the message is stored in the message lake
    * ensure the access control lists are updated
      for this message
    * dispatch any WebSub events required for this message

    Note: the inbound message may have come from
    one of two sources: it may be a message from within
    this country, or it may be a message sent from another country.
    This use-case works with either message,
    however it needs to know which country it is working as
    to get the logic right
    (that is why it takes a country parameter
    when it is instantiated).
